# Corey Scruggs - Brand Positioning

## The Problem We're Solving

**For Corey:**
Known in auto industry, new to insurance consulting → risk of looking like a "jack of all trades"

**The Solution:**
Don't hide the auto background. **Lead with it.** You're not pivoting - you're sharing what you discovered.

## The Positioning

### What You're NOT
- ❌ Insurance salesman
- ❌ Financial planner cosplaying as consultant
- ❌ Theory guy who's never done it

### What You ARE
- ✅ **Multi-business operator** (30+ years, automotive finance)
- ✅ **Actual user** of captive reinsurance (13 years, multiple ventures)
- ✅ **Operator helping operators** access the same strategies

- Deal Machine
- Ajax Partners origin
- Multiple ventures
- Decades of experience

### Act 2: Discovered the secret weapon

## Content Themes (70/30 Rule)

### 70% - Business Operator Content
- Building multiple businesses
- Automotive finance insights
- Scaling without employees (agents)
- Memphis entrepreneurship
- Discipline & systems

### 30% - Reinsurance Strategy
- "Here's what I discovered..."
- Tax strategies for operators
- Wealth building through insurance
- When it makes sense (and when it doesn't)

**Why this works:**
- Establishes credibility first
- Makes insurance secondary (less salesy)
- Attracts right audience (business owners, advisors who serve them)
- Natural lead-in: "Want to know how I do it?"
