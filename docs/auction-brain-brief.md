# Quick Brief for Claude Code

Hey Claude, I need you to build an intelligent auction management system with three core features:

## 1. The Brain 🧠
Automatically scan auction runlists and flag vehicles with strong buying signals:
- Price anomalies (below market value)
- High-demand models
- Low mileage gems
- Fast-mover patterns

Alert me immediately on high-confidence opportunities (90%+).

## 2. Calendar View 📅
Weekly layout showing all auction runlists organized by day:
- Click Tuesday → See all auctions happening that day
- Each auction shows vehicle count + signal count (🔥)
- Real-time population as runlists load
- Visual, clean, easy to scan

## 3. Chat Interface 💬
Claude-style natural language queries:
- "Show me all Honda CR-Vs under $15k this week"
- "Which auction has the best opportunities?"
- "Alert me when 2019+ F-150s appear under $25k"

Process queries with Claude API, return conversational responses with actionable data.

See `auction-brain-spec.md` (17KB)

**Goal:** Make auction buying intelligent, visual, and conversational. No more spreadsheet hell.

**Timeline:** Phase 1 (intelligence) by end of week, full system in 4 weeks.

Let's build something awesome. 🚀
