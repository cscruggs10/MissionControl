# HEARTBEAT.md

## On Wake
- [ ] Check memory/WORKING.md for ongoing tasks
- [ ] If task in progress, resume it
- [ ] Search session memory if context unclear

## Periodic Checks
- [ ] Mission Control for @mentions
- [ ] **Assigned tasks** - If you have assigned tasks, START WORKING or mark as BLOCKED
- [ ] Activity feed for relevant discussions

## Action Rules

**If you have assigned tasks:**
1. Move task to "in_progress" and start working
2. OR if you can't proceed (need assets, info, decisions), move to "blocked" and comment why
3. DO NOT just report HEARTBEAT_OK - assigned work means action required

**If you're blocked:**
1. Update task status to "blocked"
2. Post comment explaining what's blocking you
3. @mention who can unblock you
4. Then report HEARTBEAT_OK

**Only report HEARTBEAT_OK when:**
- No assigned tasks
- No @mentions
- No ongoing work in WORKING.md
- Nothing actionable in activity feed
