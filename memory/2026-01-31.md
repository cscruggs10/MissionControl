**Evening (Production Bug Fix):**
- Fixed 404 error on `/api/scrape` endpoint ✅
  - Root server.js was missing the scrape route
  - Merged auction-scraper/server.js functionality into root server.js
  - Added multer upload handling, Server-Sent Events streaming, scraper spawning
  - Pushed fix to production

**Issue:** Production was running root `server.js` (which had basic routes + broken import), not `auction-scraper/server.js` (which had working upload/scrape endpoint)

**Next:**
- Test production deployment after fix
- Add additional memory files
- Build 1-2 sub agents
