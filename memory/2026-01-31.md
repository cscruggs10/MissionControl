## Daily Log

**Morning:**
- Built AutoIntel frontend UI ✅
  - Drag-and-drop CSV upload
  - Auction name + date input fields
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Express server with streaming updates
  - Server runs on http://localhost:3000

**Afternoon:**
- Added `MARKETING_AGENT.md` to workspace ✅
  - Ajax Partners GTM playbook
  - Two-pronged strategy: Alpha Directory (business owners) + Wealth Systems (advisors)
  - Digital Gravity framework (Cody Schneider)
  - Direct outreach model: Loom videos, cold calls, handwritten letters
  - Ready to spawn marketing sub-agent

**Evening (Production Bug Fix + Major Upgrade):**

**Fix 1: 404 error on `/api/scrape` endpoint** ✅
- Root server.js was missing the scrape route
- Merged auction-scraper/server.js functionality into root server.js
- Added multer upload handling, Server-Sent Events streaming, scraper spawning
- Pushed fix to production

**Fix 2: Connected API routes properly** ✅
- Mounted routes/api.js in server.js at `/api`

**Upgrade: Smart Matching + Selective Scraping** ✅
- **OLD FLOW:** Upload CSV → scrape ALL vehicles (slow, wasteful)
- **NEW FLOW:** Upload CSV → match against historical data → scrape ONLY matched vehicles

**New 3-Step UI:**
1. **Upload runlist CSV** → System matches against historical sales data
2. **Review matches** → See stats (X matched, Y unmatched) + top matches preview
3. **Scrape matched only** → Only vehicles with historical data get scraped via AUTONIQ

**Technical changes:**
- Matching now runs **synchronously** (awaits completion before returning)
- New endpoint: `POST /api/runlist/:id/scrape` (scrapes only matched vehicles)
- Frontend rewrite: 3-step flow with progress tracking
- Pulled latest code to server ✅

**Why it matters:** Saves time, reduces load on AUTONIQ, focuses scraping on high-value targets

**Next:**
- Test new flow in production
- Add additional memory files
- Build 1-2 sub agents
