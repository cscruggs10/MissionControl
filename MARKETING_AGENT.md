# MARKETING_AGENT.md — Ajax Partners GTM Playbook

> **For Iris:** This document enables you to spawn and guide a Marketing Agent. The strategy follows Cody Schneider's Digital Gravity framework, adapted for Ajax Partners' unique positioning challenge.

## The Philosophy: Digital Gravity (Not Funnels)

Traditional marketing funnels are linear and static. Digital Gravity is different:

**People don't buy in straight lines.** They orbit your brand — interacting, drifting away, getting pulled back in, doing three rotations before they land. Your job is to build **digital mass** that creates gravitational pull.

**The goal:** Be everywhere your target customers look. Build so much presence that you become the obvious choice when they're ready.

**Core principle:** "Funnels create linear growth. If you want exponential growth, you need digital gravity." — Jordan Mix

## The Ajax Partners Opportunity

### Two Audiences, Two Messages

We have two distinct targets with different pain points and different pitches:

**Audience 1: Business Owners**
- Pain: Paying too much in taxes, want legal strategies to reduce
- Message: **Lead with tax savings** — that's exactly what they're searching for
- Channel: Alpha Directory (SEO-driven, captures inbound demand)
- Outcome: Connect them with CPAs/Advisors who understand our structures

**Audience 2: CPAs & Wealth Advisors**
- Pain: Commoditized, competing on price, clients see them as interchangeable
- Message: **Lead with differentiation** — become a forward-thinking strategic advisor
- Channel: Wealth Systems partnership pitch (Loom, calls, letters)
- Outcome: They offer our insurance structure as a unique tool, we send them deal flow

### Why This Works

The industry frowns on *advisors* pitching captive insurance purely as a tax dodge. But business owners actively searching "how to reduce business taxes"? That's existing demand — we're just meeting it.

By capturing business owners through the Alpha Directory and routing them to partner advisors, everyone wins:

- Business owner gets introduced to legitimate tax strategy
- Advisor looks like a genius (forward-thinking, not commoditized)
- We build relationships with advisors who want more deal flow
- Advisors refer captive services to other clients

## The Two-Pronged GTM Strategy

### Prong 1: Alpha Directory (Capture Business Owners)

**Target:** Business owners actively searching for tax strategies

**Message:** Tax savings. Period. That's what they want, that's what we lead with.

**Asset:** [The Alpha Directory](https://wealthe-advisor-hub-production.up.railway.app/)

**How it works:**
1. Business owner searches "how to reduce business taxes" or similar
2. Finds Alpha Directory via SEO
3. Browses curated list of strategic CPAs/Wealth Advisors
4. Submits info to connect with a professional
5. We capture that lead
6. Route to partner advisor who understands captive structures
7. Advisor introduces the strategy in context
8. Business owner wins, advisor wins, we win

**Marketing focus:**
- SEO content targeting tax savings keywords
- Paid ads to business owners (Facebook, Google)
- Content that speaks directly to tax pain
- No hedging — own the tax savings message

---

### Prong 2: Wealth Systems (Recruit CPAs & Advisors)

**Target:** CPAs and Wealth Advisors tired of being commoditized

**Message:** Stop competing on price. Become a forward-thinking strategic advisor.

**Asset:** [Wealth Systems Landing Page](https://cpacaptivelandingpage.vercel.app/)

**The pitch:**
- "Your competitors are commoditized tax preparers and cookie-cutter advisors"
- "You can offer something different — a thoughtful approach your clients can't get elsewhere"
- "We give you the structure, the infrastructure, and the deal flow"
- "Position yourself as the advisor who thinks three steps ahead"

**What they get:**
- Access to captive insurance structure (no infrastructure to build)
- Deal flow from Alpha Directory (we send them qualified business owners)
- Differentiation in a crowded market
- Revenue share / referral fees

**Marketing focus:**
- Direct outreach (Loom, cold calls, handwritten letters)
- LinkedIn presence targeting advisors
- Newsletter for staying top of mind
- Case studies showing advisor differentiation

---

## The Cody Schneider Playbook (Adapted for Ajax)

### Phase 1: Build Digital Mass (Direct Outreach Model)

**1. Loom Videos (The Personal Touch)**

Personalized video messages sent directly to CPAs and Wealth Advisors.

**Why Loom works:**
- Shows your face, builds trust before you ever meet
- Takes 2-3 minutes to record, feels like 10x the effort to recipient
- Can't be ignored like another cold email
- Demonstrates you're a real person who did homework on them

**Loom outreach framework:**
- Open with something specific about THEM (their firm, a post they wrote, their niche)
- 60-90 seconds max
- Clear value prop: "I help advisors like you offer tax-advantaged strategies to your business owner clients"
- Soft CTA: "Worth a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?"

**Volume target:** 10-20 personalized Looms per week

**2. Handwritten Letters (Pattern Interrupt)**

In a world of digital noise, handwritten letters get opened and read.

**When to use:**
- After initial Loom (no response) — follow up with a letter
- High-value targets (large CPA firms, RIAs with +$100M+ AUM)
- Thank you notes after calls (reinforces relationship)

**Letter framework:**
- Short (3-4 sentences)
- Personal (reference something specific)
- One clear next step
- Handwritten envelope = 99% open rate

**Volume target:** 10-15 letters per week

**3. Cold Calling (Direct Conversations)**

The fastest path to a real conversation.

**Call framework:**
- Pattern interrupt opener (not "How are you today?")
- Permission-based: "Did I catch you at a bad time?"
- Value hook in 10 seconds: "I work with CPAs who want to offer tax-advantaged strategies to their business owner clients without building the infrastructure themselves"
- Goal: Book a 15-minute discovery call, not sell on first call

**Volume target:** 20-30 dials per day when in outreach mode

**Sequencing (The Multi-Touch Play):**
1. Day 1: Loom video email
2. Day 3: Follow-up email (text only, short)
3. Day 5: Cold call attempt
4. Day 7: Handwritten letter mailed
5. Day 14: Second Loom (different angle)
6. Day 21: Final call attempt

**4. Newsletter (Authority + Stay Top of Mind)**

Weekly or bi-weekly newsletter to your growing list.

**Content themes:**
- Tax strategy insights (not advice, insights)
- Case studies (anonymized)
- Industry news affecting business owners
- Quick tips CPAs/Advisors can share with clients

**List building:**
- Everyone you Loom gets added
- Everyone you call gets added
- Alpha Directory signups
- LinkedIn connections

**Goal:** Become the person they think of when captive insurance comes up

**5. Programmatic SEO**
- Target long-tail keywords business owners search:
  - "how to reduce business taxes legally"
  - "captive insurance vs traditional insurance"
  - "wealth advisor tax strategies"
  - "CPA business owner tax planning"
- AI-assisted content generation at scale
- Aim for DA 40+ before scaling

**3. Cold Email + Ads (Surround Sound)**
- Scrape target CPAs and wealth advisors via Apollo.io
- Cold email introducing partnership opportunity
- Run retargeting ads to the same list
- When they see email → then see ad → credibility compounds

### Phase 2: Content Engine (Outreach-First Model)

**Weekly Content Rhythm:**

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Record 10-15 Loom videos, batch cold calls |
| Tuesday | Send Looms, continue calls, write 2-3 handwritten letters |
| Wednesday | Follow-up emails, more calls, LinkedIn engagement |
| Thursday | Newsletter writing + LinkedIn post |
| Friday | Mail letters, review week's responses, plan next week's targets |

**Content repurposing (without podcast):**
- Turn Loom scripts into LinkedIn posts
- Turn newsletter issues into blog posts (SEO)
- Turn call learnings into content ideas
- Screenshot/share wins (new partnerships, testimonials)

**LinkedIn as the Public Layer:**
- Post 3-5x per week
- Comment on CPA/Advisor content
- Share insights from conversations (anonymized)
- Build visibility while direct outreach builds relationships

### Phase 3: Always-On Systems

**Old model:** Campaigns with start/end dates

**New model:** Perpetual motion machine

**Components:**
- Weekly podcast drops
- Daily social content (automated from repurposing)
- Cold email sequences running continuously
- Retargeting ads always on
- SEO content compounding over time
